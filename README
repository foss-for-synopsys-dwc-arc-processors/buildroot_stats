BUILDROOT PACKAGE BUILD STATS

This repository is a site/scrapper to autobuild.buildroot.net.
It creates a web-interface to view package building information 
for the different buildroot executions provided through the site.

It works by parsing the execution config file, identifying which 
packages were built and setting the database accordingly to package
build or failure.

This project filters database recovering for ARC architecture. For
a different architecture you should rename it in scrapper.rb.
Later information for all architectures can also be recovered and 
added to the database.
